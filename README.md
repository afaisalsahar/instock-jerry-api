# BrainStation Instock API

This project is a full-stack, scalable, and time-sensitive inventory management system for a fortune 500 size company. An Agile team is assigned to build it from ground up with a modern React front-end communicating with a robust Express back-end. A project manager is assigned to set up a JIRA Scrum board with the required tasks outlined. Each team member has taken an equal split of front-end/back-end tasks and move their tickets through different columns on the JIRA board.
